## 🧠 Overview

**"برمج مستقبلك!"** is an interactive web platform that helps users — especially students and beginners — explore their personal interest in programming. Through a dynamic quiz experience, users can reflect on their learning styles, personality traits, and motivations to determine whether coding aligns with their passions.

The platform does not test technical skills. Instead, it opens the door for **self-discovery**, **confidence building**, and **community interaction**, all wrapped in a smooth and modern interface.

## 🎯 Core Feature: The Interactive Quiz

The main attraction of the site is a 10–15 question quiz designed to be fun, friendly, and free of judgment. Every question is crafted to reflect on the user's personality, goals, and creative preferences. Examples include:

- *"Do you enjoy solving puzzles creatively?"*  
- *"Would you rather build something new or improve something existing?"*

There are no right or wrong answers — only a personalized path forward.
